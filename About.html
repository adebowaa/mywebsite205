                <li>Introduced in 1992, the competition replaced the European Champion Clubs' Cup, or simply European Cup, which had run since 1955, adding a group stage to the competition and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries.</li>
                
                <li>The first edition of the European Cup took place during the 1955–56 season.</li>
                
                <li>The first team to ever win this competition was Real Madrid.</li>

The UEFA champion league anthem is titled as “champion league” which was written by tony Britten, and is a version of George Frederic Handel’s Zadok the Priest.
